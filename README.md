Artificial life and evolution on a grid. Is it better to specialize or generalize? What if the environment changes faster or slower?

The climate changes through periodic cycles as well as in unpredicatable ways.

Plants can specialize in different climates. The more specialised they are, the better they do in those climates. They will quickly die in climates they aren't suited to though.


Mostly a way for me to practice using scala.
